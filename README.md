We will make available the code involved in our study, the detailed content of the DOSPERT scale we used, the specifics of our proposed EDRAS, and all original experimental data. Notably, we have prepared the DOSPERT scale and our proposed EDRAS in both Chinese and English to facilitate their application across language environments.
